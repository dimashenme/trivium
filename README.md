This is an English translation of a of course that was taught by Misha
Verbitsky and Dmitry Kaledin at the Independent University of Moscow
in the fall of 2004 (also known under the name “Trivium”). The course
was targeted for first-year students, so the prerequisites include
only elementary high-school mathematics. It covers a broad range of
material that the authors believe is fundamental for one's
mathematical education, and culminates in algebraic Galois theory and
Galois coverings theory. It builds upon simple and straightforward
definitions and lots of exercises, so the only serious requirement
from someone taking the course is to be patient and steady.

The students who took this course in Moscow were presented with the
following set of rules: for each chapter they had to either solve all
the problems without an asterisk or solve all the problems marked with
an asterisk (in case they thought that the problems without an
asterisk were too easy or boring). Problems marked with “!” are vital
for the development of the course and must have been solved by
everyone. If one had solved k problems with double asterisk than they
had a right to skip 2k problems with a simple asterisk.


The repository contains the original Russian LaTeX source of the
course as well as the English translation.
