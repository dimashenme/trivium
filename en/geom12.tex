\begin{zadacha}[*] \label{_puti_iz_styagi_Zadacha_}
Let $M$ be contractible and let
$F:\; M\times [0,1]\arrow M$ be a homotopy from the identity map to
the constant map $M \to y \in M$. Consider the following map
$M\arrow \Omega(M, y, *)$, $t, m \arrow F(m, t)$ 
($t\in[0,1]$, $m\in M$). Prove that it is continuous.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha} 
Let $M$  be locally contractible, $x, y\in M$ be two points and
$\gamma\in \Omega(M, x, y)$ be a path. Prove that 
 $\gamma$ has a neighbourhood ${\mathcal U}\in \Omega(M, x, *)$,
such that all paths $\gamma'\in {\mathcal U}$ that connect
$x$ and $a$ are homotopic in $\Omega(M, x, a)$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Let $M$ be a locally contractible topological space, and let $x \in M$
be a point, and $\Omega(M, x, *)$ be the set of all paths that start
at the point $x$ endowed with the compact-open topology.
Consider the equivalence relation on 
$\Omega(M,x, *)$: $\gamma\sim\gamma'$ if 
$\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ connect $x$ and $y$,
and homotopic in $\Omega(M, x, y)$. Consider
$\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$ with the quotient topology.
Consider a contractible neighbourhood $U_y\ni y$,
and let $U_y\stackrel F \arrow \Omega(U_y, y, *)$ be a mapping that
was constructed in the exercise~\ref{_puti_iz_styagi_Zadacha_}. 
Let $\gamma\in \Omega(M, x, y)$ be a path and $U_y \stackrel\Psi\arrow
\Omega(M, x, *)$ be a mapping that maps $a\in U_y$ to a path
$\gamma F(a)$ (that is, to a path that is defined on
 $[0, 1/2]$ as $t \arrow \gamma(2t)$, and on
 $[1/2,1]$ as $F(a, 2t-1)$.
Prove that (for sufficiently small$U_y$) $\Psi$ composed with
$\Omega(M, x, *)\stackrel\pi\arrow\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$ is a
homeomorphism  $U_y$ on some open 
subset in $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{ukazanie}
  Continuity of $\Psi\circ\pi$ is obvious by construction and
  injectivity follows from the previous exercise. In order to show
  that $\Psi\circ\pi$ defines a homeomorphism $U_y$ on
  $\Psi\circ\pi(U_y)$ we need to show that prove $\Psi\circ\pi$ maps
  open sets to open sets. This is clear from the fact that the natural
  map $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim\arrow M$, $\gamma'\arrow \gamma'(1)$ is
  continuous and defines a homeomorphism $U_y$ on its image.
\end{ukazanie}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Consider the mapping $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim\arrow M$ that maps a path $\gamma\in \Omega(M, x, y)$

Prove that $\gamma$ is a path in $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$.
Prove that $\gamma$ is homotopic to an image of some path from 
$\Omega(M, x, *)$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{ukazanie}
  Prove that $\gamma$ can be lifted to a path in $\Omega(M, x, *)$
  locally and use the fact that for any point in
  $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$ its preimage in $\Omega(M, x, *)$ is
  connected.
\end{ukazanie}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Deduce that $\Omega(M, x, *)/\sim$ is simply connected.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zamechanie}
Let $(M, x)$ be a locally connected topological space
with a marked point. The universal covering of $M$ can be thus
identified  with the set of pairs ($y\in M$, homotopy class
of a path  $\gamma\in \Omega(M,x,y)$).
