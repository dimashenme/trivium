Let $M$ be a \ts . Recall that a {\bf path} in  $M$ is 
a continuous mapping $[a, b] \stackrel \phi \arrow M$.
In this case one says that the path 
$\phi$ {\bf connects the points $\phi(a)$ and $\phi(b)$}.
$M$ is called {\bf \pc} when any two points
of $M$ can be connected by a path $[a, b] \stackrel \phi \arrow M$.

A \ts\ $M$ is called locally connected (respectively, locally \pc ),

\begin{zadacha}[**]
Let $\omega$ be the smallest uncountable ordinal, and
$\phi:\; [0,1] \arrow \omega$ the corresponding bijection.
Let $X \subset [0,1]\times [0,1]$ be the subset of the square

Let $M$ be a complete locally compact metric space.
Recall that a {\bf geodesic} in

$[a, b] \arrow M$.
We say that $M$ is {\bf geodesically connected} if any
two points can be connected by a geodesic.
Obviously such a space is \pc .
\end{opredelenie}

\begin{opredelenie}
Let $M$ be a complete locally compact metric space.
We say that $M$ is 
{\bf Lipschitz connected}, with Lipschitz constant
$C\geq 1$, if for any 
$x, y \in M$ and any $\epsilon >0$ there exists 
a sequence of points 
$x=x_1, x_2,\dots, x_n=y$ such that 
$d(x_i, x_{i+1})< \epsilon$, 
$\sum_i d(x_i, x_{i+1}) \leq C d(x,y)$.
In other words, one can place 
$n$ points between $x$ and $y$  so that they are at distance
at most
$\epsilon$ from each other, whereas the length of the polygonal line
they form is at most  $C d(x,y)$.
\end{opredelenie}

\begin{zadacha}[*] 
Show that any geodesically connected metric space
is Lipschitz connected with Lipschitz constant $1$.

\begin{zadacha}[!] 
Let $(M, d)$  be a Lipshitz connected metric space, with constant $C$.
Define a function $d_h:\; M\times M \arrow \R$  as 
\[
\lim\limits_{\epsilon\arrow 0} \inf\left(\sum d(x_i, x_{i+1})\right),
\]
where $\inf$  is taken over such sequences 
$x=x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n=y$ that  $d(x_i, x_{i+1})< \epsilon$.
Show that 
$d(x, y) \leq d_h(x,y) \leq Cd(x,y)$
for any 
$x, y \in M$. Show that $d_h$ is a metric and that 
$(M, d)$ is homeomorphic to 
$(M, d_h)$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Show that $(M, d_h)$ is Lipschitz connected, for any $C>1$. 
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Show that $(M, d_h)$ satisfies Hopf-Rinow condition (and is therefore
geodesically connected).
\end{zadacha}

\begin{opredelenie}
Recall that a mapping $[a,b]\stackrel\phi\arrow M$ 
{\bf satisfies the Lipschitz condition, with constant 
$C>0$},
if $d(\phi(x),\phi(y)) \leq C|x-y|$ for any 
$x, y\in [a,b]$. It is easy to see that a Lipshitz mapping is
continuous.
\end{opredelenie}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Let $M$ be a complete 
locally compact metric space.
Show that $M$ is Lipschitz connected with constant $C$ iff
one can connect any two points by a Lipschitz path with the
same (universal for $M$) constant.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{ukazanie} 
Use the previous problem and the inequality
$d(x, y) \leq d_h(x,y) \leq Cd(x,y)$.

We have established that a Lipschitz connected metric space is 
\pc .

\begin{zadacha}  
Consider the circle $S$ on the plane with induced metric.
Show that $S$ is Lipschitz connected with constant
$\frac \pi 2$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Show that $\frac \pi 2$ is the smallest possible constant
for which the circle with such a metric is Lipschitz connected.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[**]
Consider the mapping
$]0, \infty[ \arrow \R^2$,
given in polar coordinates by the function
$\theta = 1/x$, $r=x$ (this is a spiral winding around 0 
with the step $\frac 1 {2\pi n}$).
Let $X$ be the closure of the graph of this function
(that obviously consists of the graph itself and 0).
Show that $X$ is \pc . Show that
$X$ is not Lipschitz connected, no matter what constant $C$ we take.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Let $M$ be a locally compact complete metric space.
Denote by 
$S_\epsilon(x)$ the sphere of radius $\epsilon$ with the centre in $x$.
Show that the following conditions are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\item $M$ is Lipschitz connected, with constant $C$

\item for any 
$x, y \in M$ and any $r_1, r_2 >0$ satisfying $r_1 + r_2 \leq 1$,
the distance between 
$S_{dr_1}(x)$ and $S_{dr_2}(y)$ is not bigger than 
$C d (1 - r_1 - r_2)$, where $d= d(x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{zadacha}


\begin{ukazanie}
To derive (ii) from Lipschitz connectedness, 
consider a Lipschitz curve through $x, y$.
Lipschitz connectedness follows immediately from (ii).
The distance from $x$ to  $S_{d(1-C^{-1}\epsilon)}(y)$
is at most $\epsilon$; take as  $x_2$
the point of the sphere realizing this distance
(that is possible, as the sphere is compact by Hopf-Rinow Theorem),
and use induction.
\end{ukazanie}

\begin{zamechanie}
Recall that in one version that Hopf-Rinow condition
says that the distance between  
$S_{dr_1}(x)$ and $S_{dr_2}(y)$
equals $d(1 - r_1 - r_2)$.

\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}
Let $(M, x)$ be a space with a marked point $x$.
$M_0$ the connected component of $x$, and $M_1$ the \pc\ 
component of $x$. Show that
$\Omega(M, x)=\Omega(M_0, x)=\Omega(M_1, x)$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zadacha}
Let $X, Y$ be compacts, $\cal W$ be the space of mappings from  
$X$ to  $M$ endowed with open-compact topology.
Construct a bijection between continuous mappings
from  $Y$ to $\cal W$ and continuous mappings
$X \times Y \arrow M$.
\end{zadacha}


\begin{zadacha}[!]
Let $\gamma, \gamma'\in \Omega(M,x)$. Construct a bijection between the
following sets:
\begin{enumerate}

\begin{opredelenie}
Paths $\gamma, \gamma'\in \Omega(M,x)$ for which
the mappings
$\Psi:\; [0,1]\times [0,1]\arrow M$ exist, are called

{\bf homotopy}.

\begin{zamechanie} 
Loops homotopic to each other are also called {\bf homotopy equivalent}.

Let $(M,d)$ be a geodesically connected 
locally compact metric space such that  for a

$x$ and $y$ is unique. Let
$\Delta_\delta\subset M\times M$ be the set of pairs 
$x, y\in M$, $d(x,y)<\delta$. Consider the mapping
$\Delta_\delta\arrow M$ of pairs to the middle points of
the geodesics that connect pairs. Show that it is continuous.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{ukazanie}
Let $\{(x_i, y_i)\}$ is a sequence of pairs converging to 
$(x,y)$, and 
$\{z_i\}$ the sequence of middle points of corresponding geodesics.
Due to local compactness, $\{z_i\}$ has limit points and does not
contain infinite discrete subsets. Any limit point of
$\{z_i\}$ will be the middle of geodesic connecting
$x$ and $y$. Thus
$\{z_i\}$ has unique limit point.
\end{ukazanie}

Consider the mapping

$\Psi(x,y,t)=x$). Show that this mapping is continuous.

Use the previous problem and the construction of a geodesic as the
limit of middle points of segments used in the proof of Hopf-Rinow

\begin{opredelenie}
Let $M$ be a metric space. A path
$\gamma:\; [0,1] \arrow M$  is called {\bf piecewise geodesic}

and on each of these closed intervals
$\gamma$ satisfies
$d (\gamma(x), \gamma(y)) = \lambda_i|x-y|$,
for some constant $\lambda_i$
\end{opredelenie}

\begin{zamechanie}
If $M$ is an open set in  $\R^n$ with the natural metric
then, as shown is Sheet 4, geodesics are segments.
Thus piecewise geodesics are piecewise linear.
Such mappings are also called {\bf piecewise linear}.

In the conditions of Excercise~\ref{_edi_geode_Zadacha_}, consider

\begin{zadacha}[*]
Derive from this that
$\Omega(M,x)$ is locally \pc .

Given loops  $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \in \Omega(M, x)$,

defined as follows:
\[
\gamma_1 \gamma_2(\lambda) = 
\begin{cases}
\gamma_1(2\lambda) &\qquad \lambda\in [0, 1/2],\\
\gamma_2(2\lambda-1) &\qquad \lambda\in [1/2,1].
\end{cases}
\]
Show that the class of the homotopy $\gamma_1\gamma_2$ depends only
on classes of homotopies 
$\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$: if
$\gamma_1\sim\gamma_1'$, $\gamma_2\sim\gamma_2'$
then $\gamma_1\gamma_1'\sim \gamma_2\gamma_2'$.

\begin{zadacha}
Show that $(\gamma_1\gamma_2)\gamma_3$ is homotopy equivalent to 
$\gamma_1 (\gamma_2\gamma_3)$.

\begin{zadacha} 
Given a loop $\gamma \in \Omega(M, x)$, denote by 
$\gamma^{-1}$ the loop $\gamma^{-1}(x) = \gamma(1-x)$. Show that the

trivial loop $[0,1]\arrow x$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zamechanie}
Loops that are homotopic to the trivial one are called {\bf null-homotopic}.
\end{zamechanie}

\begin{zadacha}[!]
Show that the operation $\gamma_1, \gamma_2\arrow \gamma_1\gamma_2$
makes  $\pi_1(M, x)$  into a group.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{opredelenie} 
This group is called {\bf the fundamental group} of $M$.
\end{opredelenie}

\begin{zadacha}
Let $X\stackrel f \arrow Y$ be a continuous mapping of \pc\ spaces,
and $x\in X$. Consider the corresponding mapping
$$
\Omega(X, x) \overset{\check{f}}{\arrow} \Omega(Y, f(y)),

Let $M$ be a \pc\ topological space, 
and $x, y \in M$. Consider the space
$\Omega(M, x, y)$ of paths
$[0,1]\arrow M$ connecting

As above, paths are called homotopic (homotopy equivalent)
is they lie in the same \pc\ component
of $\Omega(M, x, y)$. Define an operation
$\Omega(M, x, y) \times \Omega(M, y, z)\arrow \Omega(M,x, z)$,
$\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \mapsto \gamma_1\gamma_2$

Let $x, y \in M$, and $\gamma_{xy}[0,1] \arrow M$ be a path connecting

Consider the mapping $\Omega(M,x) \arrow \Omega(M, y)$, 
$\gamma \mapsto \gamma_{xy}^{-1}\gamma \gamma_{xy}$
and $\Omega(M,y) \arrow \Omega(M, x)$, 
$\gamma \mapsto \gamma_{xy}\gamma \gamma_{xy}^{-1}$.
Show that these mappings map homotopic paths to homotopic. 
Let $f$, $g$ be corresponding maps on fundamental groups.
Show that $f$ É $g$ are inverses of each other and induce
an isomorphism of groups
$\pi_1(M, x)\stackrel{\phi_{\gamma_{xy}}}\arrow \pi_1(M, y)$.
\end{zadacha}

\begin{zamechanie}
As can be seen from the preceding problem, if 
$\pi_1(M)$ is not abelian then the isomorphism 
$\pi_1(M, x)\cong \pi_1(M, y)$
obtained there nontrivially
depends upon the  choice of the path  
$\gamma_{xy}$. Nevertheless, when the dependence upon the
marked point is not important, the fundamental group
$M$ is denoted simply by $\pi_1(M)$. This notation is not quite correct.

In conditions of the preceding problem, let 
$x=y$, and  $\gamma_{xx}$ a path. Show that the isomorphism

the open subsets of $M/\sim$ are those, whose preimages in $M$ are open.  
In particular, if $G$ is a group acting on $M$, there is 
the natural (orbit) equivalence relation on $M$:
$x \sim y$ if there exists $g \in G$ satisfying $g \cdot x = y$.
The quotient of $M$ w.r.t. this equivalence relation

More precisely, one may define $\Gamma$ as a pair of sets
${\cal V}$, $\cal R$ and a surjection
$\{\cal R\}\times\{0,1\} \stackrel\Gamma\arrow \{\cal V\}$. 
Introduce on $\{\cal R\}\times [0,1]$ the equivalence relation 
generated by the following: endpoints of two edges are equivalent if
the are incident to the same vertex.
This relatin glues together endpoints of edges through the same vertex.
The quotient  $\{\cal R\}\times [0,1]$ w.r.t. this equivalence
relation is called the {\bf topological space of the graph}.

\begin{opredelenie}
Let $\tilde M \stackrel \pi \arrow M$ be a continuous mapping of
topological spaces;
$\pi$ is called a {\bf covering} when any point has a neighbourhood
$U$ such that $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is the product of 
$U$ and a discrete topological space
$K$, so that the natural mapping
$\pi^{-1}(U)\stackrel \pi \arrow U$
coincided the projection
$\pi^{-1}(U) = U \times K \arrow U$.
In this case one also says that 
$\tilde M$ {\bf covers} $M$.
\end{opredelenie}
